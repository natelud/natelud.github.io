I'm a Masters student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I work with [Professor Katia Sycara](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/) in the [Advanced Agent-Robotics Technology (AART) Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/advanced-agent-robotics-technology-lab/). My current research focuses on developing neuro-symbolic approaches for robot learning and human-robot interaction, with particular emphasis on using knowledge graphs to augmented reinforcement learning in my KG-RL method.

## Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and human-robot collaboration. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Knowledge Graph-Augmented Reinforcement Learning**: Integrating symbolic knowledge representations with deep reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency and interpretability in multi-agent systems
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Developing robots that can effectively collaborate with humans in shared workspaces and understand human behavior patterns
- **Physical HRI**: Exploring how robots can safely and naturally interact with humans through co-manipulation and assistive behaviors
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Building frameworks for robots to work alongside humans in dynamic, collaborative environments

## Background

Before joining CMU, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University, where I spent three years in the [RAD Lab](http://radlab.byu.edu/) under [Professor Marc Killpack](https://www.me.byu.edu/directory/marc-killpack) working on dynamic human-robot co-manipulation and control systems. I also gained industry experience at Altitude AI developing robotic automation systems.

During my time at CMU, I completed a [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS)](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/student/nathan-ludlow/) Fellowship working with [Professor John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/) in the DRIVE Lab on human driver modeling for autonomous vehicles.

## Current Work

I'm currently developing temporal knowledge graph methods for reinforcement learning (TKG-RL) with applications to collaborative robotics scenarios like the Overcooked-AI environment. This work builds on my research in neuro-symbolic AI and aims to enable robots to better understand and predict human behaviors in shared task environments. I'm collaborating with the Honda Research Institute on these projects and preparing submissions to top-tier robotics conferences.
