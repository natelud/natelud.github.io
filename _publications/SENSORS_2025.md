excerpt: 'Simultaneous measurement of force and position often relies on delicate tactile sensing systems that only measure small forces at discrete positions. This study proposes a compact, durable sensor which can provide simultaneous and continuous measurements of force and position using multiple strain gauges mounted on a cantilever beam. When a point force is applied to the cantilever, the strain gauges are used to determine the magnitude of the applied force and its position along the beam. A major advantage of the force-position sensor concept is its compact electronics and durable sensing surface. We designed, tested, and evaluated three different prototypes for the force-position sensor concept. The prototypes achieved an average percent error of 1.71% and were highly linear. We also conducted a thorough analysis of design variables and their effects on performance. The force and position measurement ranges can be adjusted by tuning the material and geometric properties of the beam and the spacing of the strain gauges. The accuracy of force measurements is dependent upon applied load, but insensitive to the location of the applied load. Accuracy of position measurements is also dependent upon applied load and weakly dependent upon position of the applied load.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
